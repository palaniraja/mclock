Additional menu clock for your Mac. A minimalist clock to display time of different timezone of your choice.  

Power to you.

[Download app](https://github.com/palaniraja/mclock/raw/master/binary/mclock.zip) 

**Note:** Apple removed the app from mac appstore because of no new update. It works for me and I do not see a need to update at the moment with more feature. Idea was to create an _app that does one thing well_. If you like the app, please consider donating.
